# Project Objective or Overview
To monitor and assess bank lending activities, a thorough bank loan analysis report was developed. The objective was to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, aiding data-driven decision-making, tracking loan portfolio health, and identifying trends for lending strategy.

# Probleme Statement
  ## KPIs Requirements
1. Total Loan Applications: Compute the total number of loan applications received during a specific time period. Monitor changes on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis.
2. Total Funded Amount: Comprehend the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Illustrate MTD and MoM changes.
3. Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow from repayments. Analyze MTD and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans. Monitor MTD and MoM variations to gain insights into the overall cost of the lending portfolio.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute average DTI for all loans and analyze MTD and MoM changes.
  ## Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs Requirement
Good Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as good loans. This category encompasses loans with a fully paid status.
Good Loan Applications: Identify the total number of good loan applications.
Good Loan Funded Amount: Calculate the total funded amount in the good loan category.
Good Loan Total Received Amount: Identify the total received amount in the good loan category.
Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the total bad loan percentage. This category encompasses charged-off loan status.
Bad Loan Applications: Identify the total number of bad loan applications.
Bad Loan Funded Amount: Identify the total bad loan funded amount.
Bad Loan Received Amount: Identify the total received amount via the bad loan category.

## Dashboard Overview Requirements

### Dashboard 1: Summary
The dashboard will present crucial loan-related metrics and trends using various chart types to provide a clear and insightful view of lending operations.
1. Monthly Trends by Total Applications : Use a line chart to visualize monthly trends in total loan applications.
2. Regional Analysis by State: Use a filled map to illustrate the regional distribution of funded amounts.
3. Loan Term-Based Analysis: Use a donut chart to depict the proportion of short-term (36 months) and long-term (60 months) loans.
4. Funded Loan by Employee Length: Use a bar chart to demonstrate the total funded loan amount by employee length.
5. Total Aoan Amount by Purpose: Use a column chart to illustrate the total funded amount by purpose.
6. Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s


### Dashboard 2: Overview
CHARTS
1.Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
